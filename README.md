What is a QR Code?
==================
A Quick Response code is a two-dimensional pictographic code used for its fast
readability and comparatively large storage capacity. The code consists of
black modules arranged in a square pattern on a white background. The
information encoded can be made up of any kind of data (e.g., binary,
alphanumeric, or Kanji symbols)
